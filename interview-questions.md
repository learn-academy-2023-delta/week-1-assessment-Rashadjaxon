# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:
//take turns, take breaks, communicate. 
//Drivers do all the typing and Navigators plan out the next steps and assist

Researched answer:
//Pair programming involves two roles: the driver, who writes the code, and the navigator, who observes, reviews, and guides the driver. They collaborate closely, switching roles frequently to enhance productivity, code quality, and learning.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Higher Order Functions: from my understanding, a higher order function is a function that can return a function

2. Jest: 
Jest is a javascript testing framework, used to verify the correctness of the code

3. Objects: 
Objects act as an intersection between behavior and data 

4. Method: a function that is defined as a property of an object 

5. Classes: classes provide a blueprint for objects
